# BIPSDA

Code for "Bayesian Inverse Problem Solvers through Diffusion Annealing" (BIPSDA), a framework for solving Bayesian inverse problems using diffusion models.

The BIPDSA framework was introduced in ``Can Diffusion Models Provide Rigorous Uncertainty Quantification for Bayesian Inverse Problems?'' A preprint of the paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03007). The results of the numerical experiments conducted for this paper can be accessed directly [here](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/0L5KGB)
to enable the analysis of the approximate posterior samples produced by the BIPDSA algorithms without running the code. 

# Installation

This codebase has minimal dependencies and is designed to be easy to install. Simply clone this repository and setup a virtual environment or conda environment 
with PyTorch, ml_collections, logging, and matplotlib installed. The experiments can then be run without any additional setup. 

# Use 

This version of the codebase is not finalized yet; please check back within the next week for an updated codebase and instructions on how to run experiments.
